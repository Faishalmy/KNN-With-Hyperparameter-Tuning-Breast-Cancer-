# KNN-With-Hyperparameter-Tuning-Breast-Cancer
<p align="justify">
An in-depth research where I integrated expertise in machine learning, mathematics, and optimization techniques to improve classification accuracy. Using Python, this research includes applying data pre-processing to handle outliers and standardizing the dataset to ensure optimal data quality. In addition, a hyperparameter tuning technique through Grid Search is applied to produce a more optimized KNN model in breast cancer classification.
